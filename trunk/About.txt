 Welcome to 'alto', abstraction of 'syntelos' and foundation of
 'syntelos-sx'.

  This package separates the essential working models and interfaces
  of the syntelos web service engine from their systemic
  implementations.

  For more information, refer to the 'alto' wiki and the
  implementation of 'alto' in the 'syntelos' and 'syntelos-sx'
  packages.


  Note that this software can change from version to version without
  more regard for backward compatibility than for forward progress.
  Dependent code should be recompiled on each update.
