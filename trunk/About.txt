 Welcome to 'alto', the abstraction layer of 'syntelos' and 'syntelos-sx'.

  This package separates the essential working models and interfaces
  of the syntelos web service engine from their systemic
  implementations.

  For more information, refer to the 'alto' wiki and the
  implementation of 'alto' in the 'syntelos' and 'syntelos-sx'
  packages.
